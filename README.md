# Frontend Mentor - News Homepage Solution

This is my solution to the **News Homepage** challenge on Frontend Mentor. This project focuses on building a responsive news landing page with a clean editorial layout, interactive navigation, and modern frontend best practices using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The challenge was a great opportunity to practice layout techniques with CSS Grid and Flexbox, responsive design, and simple UI interactivity.

## Overview
This project is a responsive news homepage that adapts seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. It features a multi-column editorial layout on larger screens, a mobile-friendly single-column layout, and an interactive hamburger menu for smaller devices.

The goal was to closely replicate the provided design while keeping the code clean, semantic, and maintainable, following modern frontend standards.

## The challenge
Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device’s screen size.
- See different layouts for desktop and mobile using responsive design techniques.
- Open and close the mobile navigation menu using a hamburger icon.
- Experience smooth UI state changes such as overlays and hover states.
- Navigate a layout that closely matches the original Frontend Mentor design.

## My process
- Structured the page using **semantic HTML5** elements such as `header`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, `article`, and `aside`.
- Designed the main layout using **CSS Grid** for the editorial structure and **Flexbox** for component alignment.
- Implemented **responsive design** with media queries to adapt the layout across multiple breakpoints.
- Used **CSS custom properties (variables)** to manage colors and maintain visual consistency.
- Followed the **BEM methodology** for class naming to keep the CSS scalable and easy to maintain.
- Built an interactive mobile navigation menu using **vanilla JavaScript**, controlling UI states via CSS classes.
- Implemented a background overlay using CSS pseudo-elements to enhance the mobile menu UX.
- Ensured hover and focus states for better usability and accessibility.
